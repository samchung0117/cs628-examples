# HOS04: React - Interaction and State
##  Learning Outcomes
1.	Understand the concept of interactions in React and how user actions trigger changes in the user interface.
2.	Implement event handlers and event binding to capture user interactions and respond with appropriate actions in React components.
3.	Apply state management techniques in React to store and manage component-specific data and handle dynamic changes in the UI.
4.	Differentiate between stateful and stateless components in React and understand when to use each based on the component's responsibilities and data requirements.
5.	Develop interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React by combining event handling, state management, and component composition.
