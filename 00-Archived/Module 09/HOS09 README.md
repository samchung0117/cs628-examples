# HOP09 - MERN 
##  Learning Outcomes
1.	Understand the MERN Stack architecture and its components, including Node, MongoDB Atlas, Express, and React.
2.	Design and implement server-side APIs using Express and Express Router to interact with MongoDB Atlas for data storage and retrieval.
3.	Develop front-end components and user interfaces using React, utilizing React Router for client-side routing and navigation.
4.	Establish communication between the front end and back end by connecting the React application to the Express API endpoints.
5.	Apply concepts of data management and state handling in the MERN Stack, using React's state and props to pass data between components.
6.	Implement a practical web application example, such as an Employee Record Management system, using the MERN Stack, demonstrating the integration of Node, MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, and React Router.
