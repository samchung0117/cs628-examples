# HOS03: React - User Interface
##  Learning Outcomes
1.	Import and export modules in React to organize and reuse code across different files and components.
2.	Understand JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax and its role in creating React elements that represent the user interface.
3.	Utilize JSX expressions and JavaScript objects within JSX to dynamically render content and compute values based on data or conditions.
4.	Understand and apply props in React to pass data and configuration to child components and customize their behavior.
5.	Implement conditional rendering in React components to selectively render content based on specific conditions or state.
6.	Render lists of data in React components using mapping techniques and JSX to dynamically generate multiple elements.
