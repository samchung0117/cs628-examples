# HOS08: Node, Express, and Express Router
##  Learning Outcomes
1.	Understand the role of Node.js and Express.js in building server-side applications.
2.	Apply middleware functions in Express to handle common tasks and enhance the functionality of web applications.
3.	Design and implement RESTful API endpoints using Express and Express Router for handling HTTP requests and responses.
4.	Implement CRUD operations in an Express web application to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on data.
5.	Configure and manage routes using Express Router to organize and structure the application's endpoints.
6.	Demonstrate understanding of the concepts by developing a web application example, such as an Employee Record Management system, using Node, Express, and Express Router.
7.	Develop front-end components and user interfaces using React, utilizing React Router for client-side routing and navigation.
8.	Establish communication between the front end and back end by connecting the React application to the Express API endpoints.
9.	Apply concepts of data management and state handling in the MERN Stack, using React's state and props to pass data between components.
10.	Implement a practical web application example, such as an Employee Record Management system, using the MERN Stack, demonstrating the integration of Node, MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, and React Router.
