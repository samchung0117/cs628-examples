# HOS05: React - State and What You Step Outside
##  Learning Outcomes
1.	Understand the concept of state in React and its role in managing dynamic data within components.
2.	Implement state management in React applications using local component state, including useState and setState hooks.
3.	Design and develop components that maintain, and update state based on user interactions or external events.
4.	Explore advanced techniques and escape hatches in React for cases where the typical React data flow is insufficient.
